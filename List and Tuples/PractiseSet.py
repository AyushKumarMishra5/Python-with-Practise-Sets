# Question1: Write a program which takes user input for 7 fruits in a list
# f1 = input("Enter your first fruit: ")
# f2 = input("Enter your second fruit: ")
# f3 = input("Enter your third fruit: ")
# f4 = input("Enter your fouth fruit: ")
# f5 = input("Enter your fifth fruit: ")
# f6 = input("Enter your sixth fruit: ")
# f7 = input("Enter your seventh fruit: ")

# fruitList.append(f3)
# fruitList.append(f4)
# fruitList.append(f5)
# fruitList.append(f6)
# fruitList.append(f7)

# print(fruitList)

# Question2: Write a program to accept marks of 6 students and write them in a sorted manner
# s1 = int(input("Enter the marks of first student: "))
# s2 = int(input("Enter the marks of second student: "))
# s3 = int(input("Enter the marks of third student: "))

#Question 3: Check that a tuple type cannot be changed in python
# t1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# t1[0] = 2
# print(t1)    # it clearly shows that a as tuple has a property that it is immutable it cannot be changed.


#Question 4: Write a program to sum with a list of 4 numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter first Number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second Number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third Number: "))
num4 = int(input("Enter fourth Number: "))

sumList = []
sumList.append(num1)
sumList.append(num2)
sumList.append(num3)
sumList.append(num4)

print("The sum of the four numbers entered by the user is: ", num1+num2+num3+num3)


#Question 5: Write the program to count the number of zeros in the following program
a = (7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9)
#using the count method to find the number os zeros in the tuple
print("The number od zeros present in the following tupple is: ", a.count(0))

# I am happy to complete another topic with answering the practise set
