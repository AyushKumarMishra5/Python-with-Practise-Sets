# write a program to add two numbers
a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

print("The sum of two numbers is: ", a+b)

# Write a program to find the remainder when divided by another number

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

getRemainder = num1 % num2

print("The remainder after dividing the first number by second is: ", getRemainder)

# Question 3: check the type of variable assigned using input function

input1 = 22
input2 = "AYush"

print("The type of input1 is: ", type(input1))
print("The type of input2 is: ", type(input2))

#Question 4: Using comparison operator find a is greater or b take a=34 b=80

a = 34
b = 80

print("Checking wheather a is greater than b: ", a>b)

#question 5: write a program to find the average of two numbers entered by user

num3 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num4 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

print("The average of two numbers {num3} and {num4} entered by user is: ", (num3+num4)/2)

# Question 6: Write a program to calculate the square of number enterd by the user.

sqr1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
sqr2 = int(input("Enter the number of times you want to find the square of it: "))

print("The square of the number{sqr1} entered by the user is: ", sqr1**sqr2)
